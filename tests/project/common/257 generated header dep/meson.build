project('generated header dep', 'c')

# Regression test case for a very specific case:
# - Uses both_libraries(), or library() with default_library=both.
# - A header file is generated by a custom_target() and passed as source.
# - A C file that uses that header is passed as a declare_dependency() source.
# Under those specific conditions, the static library used to miss an order
# dependency on the header file. This happened in GLib:
# https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/merge_requests/2917.

    output: 'foo.h',
